Currently working on:
api key
    https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18684/how-to-implement-an-api-key-mechanism#18687        
-implement optional response cacheing    
    first draft of this is done
split up generators into modules, implement automatic registration (maybe later)

generator tags:
-addresses
    make zipCode take a statecode and return valid zc for state
        generating REAL VALID zc's is not trivial
lat/long
-middle names/initials
-name prefixes
-name suffixes
-phone nums (extentions, country codes)
-numbers (general)
-date/time
-timezones
-random strings
    could add more than just alphanumeric
domains/urls
Ip addresses (4/6)
colors
currencies
bank stuff (CC, routing, acct #)
hashes
person stuff
company
-arrays of elements
time series data (stocks)
weather data
lorem ipsum

ideas:
rest features? (map url paths to saved schemas)

use cases:
front-end mocking
generating test datasets (backend mocking)
